# ReactJS Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing my skills and understanding of React.js. Each project demonstrates different aspects of React.js and related technologies:

Basic React Counter App: A simple counter application that demonstrates core React.js concepts such as state management, reusable components, basic hooks, and error handling.

Testimonial: A component to display testimonials, illustrating the use of props and component reusability.

Tourism Plane: A project showcasing the use of API handling and filtering to display information about tourism destinations.

Top Courses: An application that fetches and displays top courses, demonstrating API handling and data filtering.

Form Using React: A form implementation highlighting state management, handling user input, conditional rendering, and validation.

Blog Context: An application utilizing the Context API for state management to create an information and communication technology blog. This project showcases how the Context API can be used to share global or app-level state across components without manual prop passing.

Shopapp_Redux: An e-commerce web application that integrates Redux Toolkit for store setup, slices, reducer creation, and action dispatching. It also uses React Router DOM for seamless page navigation without page refresh. The application includes features like adding/removing products, dynamic price updates, and managing the shopping cart.

These projects collectively demonstrate my proficiency in React.js, including core concepts, state management, API handling, and integration with Redux for advanced state management. Each project is a testament to my ability to create functional and user-friendly web applications using React.js.
